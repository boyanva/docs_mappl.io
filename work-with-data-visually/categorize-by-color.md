# Categorize items by color

Use custom color tags to track the changing state of data items in your spatial table. You can use this method to indicate the completion state of tasks, as well as the importance of items, or the satisfaction level of customers.

This technique is a great alternative to Kanban boards, as it uses color to indicate state of task completion, while allowing for labeled rectangles to show supplementary task characteristics.

The example below shows how this approach can be used to track marketing tasks for a team. The states of completion are defined in the Color tags areas.&#x20;

#### Results table view

The color status for each time in the results table appears in the Color Labels column. These columns are exclusive to spatial tables that incorporate a Color tags label.&#x20;

Color tags can function alongside other categorization methods supported by the app. As shown in the example below, the results table also features a vertical category hierarchy.
