# Categorize items by color

Design a custom color tag legend and apply sticky note colors to represent varying states of data items in your spatial table.&#x20;

Utilize this approach to indicate the state of completion for tasks or other possible descriptors, such as happy/unhappy customers or important/unimportant items.

The example below highlights how this technique can be a fitting alternative to Kanban boards, using color distinctions for task status and labeled rectangles for conveying supplementary task characteristics.

#### Results table view

The color status in the results table appears in the Color Labels column. These columns are exclusive to spatial tables that incorporate a Color tags label. Color tags function alongside other categorization methods supported by the app.&#x20;

As shown in the example below, the results table also features a vertical category hierarchy, in addition to item backlinks.&#x20;
