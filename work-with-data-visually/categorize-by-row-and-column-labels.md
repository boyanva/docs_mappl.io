description: Associate data items with two separate categories
---

# Categorize items by using row and column labels

Place data items (sticky notes or text boxes) in rectangles associated to both vertical and horizontal labels. Work visually within a familiar table view.&#x20;

Take advantage of the spatial table's ability to include multiple items per cell, which can be examined later in the results table view.&#x20;

Use this technique to compare data items across diverse categories and identify items with similar or distinct features.&#x20;

The spatial table below illustrates a straightforward example of employing this approach to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of competitors, as well as your primary competitive advantage relative to them

The results table view resolves the vertical categories using [hierarchies](categorize-using-hierarchies.md). Horizontal labels are included in a separate column.
