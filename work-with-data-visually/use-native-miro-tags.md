# Use native Miro tags

You can use native Miro tags as part of a spatial table if this is your preferred way of tagging. The tags will be processed and will be included in the results table. You can use Miro tags exclusively or you can combine with with other tagging methods for even more control.

The table blow has two Miro tags applied to it. A blue _important_ tag and a red _urgent_ tag.
