# Filter

In the results table, you have the ability to filter data before exporting it to other applications. There are two types of filters you can apply to narrow down your results.&#x20;

The first filter is a general search field located in the top left of the results table. This filter works across all columns and displays rows that contain a text match to the search term.&#x20;

The second filter is specific to a column, allowing for more precise control. To use this filter, click on the three horizontal line icon in the column header and a pop-up will appear where you can specify the search criteria. You can choose whether the search term should be contained or not contained in the column, whether the column should start or end with it, and more.
