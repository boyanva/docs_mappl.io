# Results table overview

The results table view displays your spatial tables in a table format and includes all relevant hierarchies and category types based on your input. It's an efficient way to assess your data and identify any conversion errors.&#x20;

With the ability to sort and filter your data, you can easily make changes to the information displayed.&#x20;

Once you've reviewed and made any necessary changes, you can export your data as a CSV file for use in other applications.
