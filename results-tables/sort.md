# Sort

To sort the data in the results table, you can click on the column header of the column you want to sort.&#x20;

By default, a column with no manual sorting applied does not show an arrow. When you click on a column header once, an upward arrow will appear and the column will be sorted in ascending order.&#x20;

Clicking on the same column header again will make a downward arrow appear, and the column will be sorted in descending order.

&#x20;If you click the column header a third time, the sorting will go back to its default state.
