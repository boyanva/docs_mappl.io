# Use native Miro tags

You can use native Miro tags as part of a spatial table if this is your preferred way of tagging. The tags will be processed and will be included in the results table. You can use Miro tags exclusively or you can combine then with with other tagging methods, such as color or shape tagging, for even more control.

The table blow has two Miro tags applied to it. A blue _important_ tag and a red _urgent_ tag.

#### Results table view

The Miro tags for each item in the results table based on the spatial table above appears in the Miro Tags column. Such a column will only be visible by default if the associated spatial table contains Miro tags.
