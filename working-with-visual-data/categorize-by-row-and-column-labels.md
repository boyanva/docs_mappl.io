description: Associate data to horizontal labels and vertical labels

# Categorize items by using row and column labels

Visually place sticky notes or text data items into rectangles that represent table cells (see image below). Each cell is associated with both a vertical and a horizontal label which can then be resolved during table conversion.

This feature helps you compare data items across different categories and identify items that have similar features. Working with this very familiar table view type allows you organize your data visually, making it easier to spot patterns and insights.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can include multiple sticky notes or text items in each cell, which is then handled for you during the data conversion to the regular table view.
{% endhint %}



The spatial table below illustrates an example of using vertical and horizontal labels to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a company's competitors, as well as the company's main competitive advantages relative to each competitor.

#### Results table view

The results table view based on the above spatial table shows the handling of vertical and horizontal labels. The vertical categories use [hierarchies](categorize-using-hierarchies.md) and are included in the _Top-level Labels_ and _Second-level Labels_ columns. Horizontal labels are included in a separate column. The table has been [sorted ](../results-tables/sort.md)based on horizontal labels.&#x20;
