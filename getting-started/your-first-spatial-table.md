5. Notice how sticky notes are utilized as data items, representing individual pieces of information stored in the spatial table. Note that text boxes can also function as data items under [some conditions](../working-with-visual-data/practical-tips.md#working-with-sticky-note-and-text-box-data-items).&#x20;
