# Getting started

### What is mappl.io spatial tables

The [Miro app](https://miro.com/marketplace/spatial-tables/) allows you to work with your data visually and intuitively, directly within your Miro board.

It analyzes your board's content and presents it as a table that includes all extracted spatial information.

With this tool, you can categorize data using hierarchical structures, apply various tagging methods, label groups of sticky notes, or use connector lines to define relationships.

It effectively transforms your Miro board into a database.

### **Work visually and then convert your data to an exportable table**

1\) Use one of our included spatial table examples or [Miroverse templates](https://miro.com/miroverse/search/?term=mappl.io). This example uses the color of sticky notes to assign task status.

2\) View the the same data as a table and soft and filter the table as needed. Note how the table categorizes each sticky note hierarchically, as well as it terms of color tags.

3\) Easily import the data to your favorite application after saving it as a  .CSV file.
