# GETTING STARTED

Mappl.io Spatial Tables allows you to work with your data visually, directly within your Miro board.

It analyzes your board's content and presents it as a table that includes all extracted spatial information.

With this tool, you can categorize data using hierarchical structures, apply various tagging methods, label groups of sticky notes, or use connector lines to define relationships.

It effectively transforms your Miro board into a database.
