# CSV export

To export the data from the results table use the "Download CSV file" button.

{% hint style="info" %}
The downloaded CSV file will reflect changes to the data made by you in the results table and will not be based on the initial version of the data.
{% endhint %}

Once the file is downloaded, you can easily import it into a third-party application of your choice, such as MS Excel, Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable, or Coda. These applications can serve as your data repository, allowing you to easily access the data you need.
