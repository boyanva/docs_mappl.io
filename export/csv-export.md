# CSV export

The app's current version offers limited export options, allowing you to only export the final version of the results table as a CSV file. Simply press the "Download CSV file" button to export the data.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It's important to note that the exported file represents the final version visible on the screen and not the initial version generated by the software.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once the file is downloaded, you can easily import it into a third-party application of your choice, such as MS Excel, Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable, or Coda. These applications can serve as your data repository, allowing you to easily access the data you need.
