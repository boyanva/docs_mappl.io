# Notion

**Use Notion as a data repository for your Miro data**. Work with separate tables for CSV file import or build a master table by appending many CSV files with a shared format. You can, for example, build a master table for all tasks in your project for an extended period of time, where you will always be able to find a particular task and go back to the original Miro board item by following the backlink.&#x20;

### Follow these steps to create a new page and import a CSV file into Notion

1. Create a new page in your Notion dashboard.
2. Rename the page and click "+ Add new", then select "Import".
3. In the pop-up, choose "CSV".
4. Select a previously saved CSV file from the results table.
5. Review the imported data in Notion.
