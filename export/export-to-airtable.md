# Airtable

**Use Airtable as a data repository for your Miro data.** Work with separate tables for CSV file import or build a master table by appending many CSV files with a shared format. You can, for example, build a master table for all tasks in your project for an extended period of time, where you will always be able to find a particular task and go back to the original Miro board item by following the backlink.

2. Click the "+ Add or Import" button at the top of the table.
3. In the pop-up, choose "CSV file".
4. Select a previously saved CSV file from mappl.io Spatial Tables results table view and click Upload.
