# Make changes to the table

You can modify the results table before exporting your data by taking advantage of the following options:

1. You can resize the column width for all columns by moving the border of the header area left or right.
2. You can reposition a column in the header area to change its relative position to the other columns in the table.
3. You can double-click on a row in the "Items" column and update the text for that particular item.

### Show empty columns&#x20;

When exporting data from the results table, empty columns are hidden by default. To display them, click on the "Show empty columns" button.&#x20;

This is useful if you want to maintain a consistent column order when appending data to a master table in another application, such a spreadsheet.
