# Make changes to the table

You can modify the results table before exporting your data by taking advantage of the following options:

1. You can resize the column width for all columns by moving the border of the header area left or right.
2. You can reposition a column in the header area to change its relative position to the other columns in the table.
3. You can double-click on a row in the "Items" column and update the text for that particular item.
